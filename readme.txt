===== Introduction =====

PHP 8.1 introduced "Deprecate passing null to non-nullable arguments of internal functions" ([[https://externals.io/message/112327|short discussion]]), which is making it difficult for developers to upgrade.

Often //NULL// is used for undefined //GET/////POST/////COOKIE// variables:

<code php>
$name = ($_POST['name'] ?? NULL);

$name = $request->input('name'); // Laravel
$name = $request->get('name'); // Symfony
$name = $this->request->getQuery('name'); // CakePHP
$name = $request->getGet('name'); // CodeIgniter
</code>

And //NULL// can be returned from many functions, e.g.

  * //array_pop()//
  * //filter_input()//
  * //mysqli_fetch_row()//
  * //error_get_last()//
  * //json_decode()//

Which makes it common for developers to pass potential //NULL// values to string functions, encoding/decoding functions, etc.

<code php>
$a = trim($name);
$a = strtoupper($name);
$a = strlen($name);
$a = urlencode($name);
$a = htmlspecialchars($name);
$a = hash('sha256', $name);
</code>

Currently this only affects those using PHP 8.1 with //E_DEPRECATED//, but it implies everyone will need to modify their code in the future.

It also applies to everyone, even if they are not using //strict_types=1//.

And while the individual modifications are easy, there are many of them, they are difficult to find, and often pointless (e.g. //urlencode(strval($name))//).

Without the changes listed below, developers will need to either use these deprecation warnings, or use strict Static Analysis (one that can determine when a variable can be //NULL//; e.g. Psalm at [[https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/error_levels/|level 3]], with no baseline).

===== Proposal =====

Update **some** internal function parameters to accept NULL, to reduce the burden for developers upgrading.

While this is in Draft, the [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-allow-null-rfc/blob/main/functions-change.md|list of functions is hosted on GitHub]] (pull requests welcome):

===== Decision Process =====

Does the function parameter work with //NULL// in the same way that it would if an empty string is provided, e.g.

  - //preg_match()// should continue to deprecate //NULL// for //$pattern//, whereas //$subject// should accept //NULL//.
  - //hash_file()// should continue to deprecate //NULL// for the //$filename//.
  - //hash()// should accept //NULL// for //$data//.
  - //substr_count()// requires a non-empty string //$needle// (continue to deprecate //NULL//).
  - //mb_convert_encoding()// requires a valid encoding for //$to_encoding// (continue to deprecate //NULL//).

You could argue some function parameters should not accept an empty string either (e.g. //strpos()// accepting an empty string for //$needle//), but that would require different RFCs, where backwards compatibility would need to be discussed.

Interesting the example quote from [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/71525|Rasmus]] is:

> PHP is and should remain:
> 1) a pragmatic web-focused language
> 2) a loosely typed language
> 3) a language which caters to the skill-levels and platforms of a wide range of users
