## Introduction

PHP 8.1 introduced "Passing null to parameter X of type string is deprecated" with internal functions ([discussion](https://externals.io/message/112327)), which is making it difficult for developers to upgrade, especially for those who do not use `strict_types`.

Often `NULL` is used for undefined `GET`/`POST`/`COOKIE` variables:

```php
$name = ($_POST['name'] ?? NULL);

$name = $request->input('name'); // Laravel
$name = $request->get('name'); // Symfony
$name = $this->request->getQuery('name'); // CakePHP
$name = $request->getGet('name'); // CodeIgniter
```

And `NULL` can be returned from many functions, e.g.

* `array_pop()`
* `error_get_last()`
* `mysqli_fetch_row()`
* `json_decode()`
* `filter_input()`

Currently this change only affects those using PHP 8.1 with `E_DEPRECATED`, but it implies everyone will need to modify their code in the future.

And those modifications are not easy (both in finding them, and quantity).

Developers will need to either use these deprecation warnings, or use strict static analysis (one that can determine when a variable can be `NULL`; e.g. Psalm at [level 3](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/error_levels/), with no baseline).

This affects every variable that could be set to `NULL`, when they are passed to any internal function that has deprecated the NULL value. And every time, developers will need to change their code, typically with the seemingly pointless task of converting those `NULL` values to an empty string.

## Proposal

To make upgrading easier, we could either:

- Allow `NULL` when `strict_types` is not being used;
- Update some of the internal functions to accept `NULL`.

# Notes

Interesting to note that this goes against the example quote from [Rasmus](http://news.php.net/php.internals/71525):

> PHP is and should remain:
> 1) a pragmatic web-focused language
> 2) a loosely typed language
> 3) a language which caters to the skill-levels and platforms of a wide range of users
